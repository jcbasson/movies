## Assumptions and key points

- I created a rough graphql endpoint to consume as I prefer developing with apollo client.
- I went with what I could the fastest, but I can do TDD and if you want tests I am happy to add them.
- A lot of things might have been overkill but they are put in place to show to forward thinking.
- I developed for desktop and mobile views where the maximum viewport width is 425px
- As I use Ubuntu I tested in Chrome and Firefox
- I injected a config file that has Batman as the default title search text as I could not see a way with the existing api to load some kind default list.
- If you have any further questions or I missed any edge cases please let me know.
